README for Fr3Sh

This is an eggdrop install for personal use by me. It is here as a reminder since I changed some things in order for the bot to work on Undernet as it should.

Also I patched a file needed to compile this bot for use on xShellz.com - tclhash.c

Scripts are altered by me, but only the output modules, not the code. Thanks go out to the original authors

bMotion IA script is from http://www.bmotion.net
